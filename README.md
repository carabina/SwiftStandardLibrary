# SwiftStandardLibrary

The Swift Standard Library is an effort to fill in the gaps where the Foundation library is missing data structures and functionality. This includes common data structures, such as stacks, queues, and heaps, as well as common functionality, such as string manipulation and number generation. This will be an ever growing library to keep adding to Swift.
